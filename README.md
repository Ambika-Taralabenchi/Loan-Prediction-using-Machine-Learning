# Loan-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Loan approval is a very important process for banking organizations. The system approves or rejects the loan applications on the basis of information provided. Recovery of loans is a major contributing parameter in the financial statements of a bank. It is very difficult to predict the possibility of payment of loan   by   the   customer.   In   recent   years   many   researchers   worked   on   loan   approval prediction   systems.  Machine Learning (ML) techniques are  very  useful  in  predicting  outcomes  for  large  amount  of  data.  In  this  Project machine  learning  algorithm Logistic  Regression(LR) is used to classify the application will be  approved or no.
